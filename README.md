# Region-Based Sales Comparison Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a dashboard to compare sales between two selected regions. The dashboard provides a comprehensive visual representation of sales data, aiding in understanding and comparing the performance of the regions. The data used in this project is sourced from the Sample Superstore dataset.

## Objective
The primary goal is to facilitate the organization's decision-making process by presenting a clear and intuitive visualization of sales data. By comparing sales figures between the two regions, the dashboard helps in identifying trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.

## Key Steps
- **Data Preparation**: Utilized the Sample Superstore dataset and organized it by segregating necessary data related to customer names and order IDs.
- **Hierarchy Creation**: Created a 'Location' hierarchy to categorize data based on the 'Country' variable.
- **Parameter Creation**: Developed parameters for selecting the Primary and Secondary regions for comparison.
- **Dashboard Development**: Designed a comprehensive dashboard displaying essential details for the selected regions.
- **Visualization**: Incorporated bar charts, line graphs, and other visual elements to represent sales figures effectively.

## Usage
To use the dashboard:
1. Access the dashboard file.
2. Open it using a compatible visualization tool (e.g., Tableau).
3. Select the Primary and Secondary regions for comparison using the provided parameters.
4. Explore the various visualizations and details showcasing sales comparisons.
